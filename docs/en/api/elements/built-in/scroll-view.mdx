# `<scroll-view>`

Basic scrolling component supporting both horizontal and vertical scrolling. When its content area is larger than its visible area, it allows users to scroll to reveal more content.

## Usage

### Horizontal and Vertical Scrolling

`<scroll-view>` supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling, implemented through the `scroll-orientation` properties.
`<scroll-view>` always uses the [linear](/guide/ui/layout/linear-layout.mdx) layout, and the layout direction is determined by the `scroll-orientation` attributes.

  example="scroll-view"
  defaultFile="src/base/App.tsx"
  highlight="{15,24}"
  entry="src/base"
/>

### Scroll Events

Use event callbacks such as [`bindscroll`](#bindscroll), [`bindscrolltoupper`](#bindscrolltoupper), and [`bindscrolltolower`](#bindscrolltolower) to monitor changes in scroll progress.

  example="scroll-view"
  defaultFile="src/event/index.tsx"
  highlight="{16-24}"
  entry="src/event"
/>

### Sticky Capability

As a child node of `<scroll-view>`, you can set the `sticky` attribute making the child node remain at a certain distance from the top of the `<scroll-view>` and not continue scrolling with the content.

  example="scroll-view"
  defaultFile="src/sticky/index.tsx"
  entry="src/sticky"
/>

:::tip
`sticky` can only be set for direct child nodes of `<scroll-view>`. On <AndroidOnly />, you need to add the `flatten={false}` attribute to `sticky` nodes.

The direct child nodes of `<scroll-view>` only support `linear` and `sticky`. If you need more complex layouts, such as child nodes adapting to expand, it is recommended to provide a single child view to the `<scroll-view>` and implement more robust CSS capabilities within that single child node.

```javascript
<scroll-view> scroll-y>
  <view> // do anything you want
  {...}
  </view>
</scroll-view>
```

## Performance Optimization Suggestions

`<scroll-view>` creates all of its child nodes at once, potentially causing severe first-screen load times. Use exposure events to drive it to create only visible child nodes.

`<scroll-view>` lacks any reuse mechanism. If content is too extensive, it may consume an exceptionally large amount of memory, possibly causing OOM and other stability problems.

For data exceeding three screens, use `<list>` to optimize performance, or simulate `<VisualizedList>` logic based on exposure events.
