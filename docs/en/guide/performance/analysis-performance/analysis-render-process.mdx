# Render Time Analysis

This document aims to help developers master how to accurately locate each execution stage in a Trace, thereby enabling effective analysis of specific performance issues.

## Analyze render time with Trace

Frontend pages can [flag Pipeline](/guide/performance/monitor-performance/timing-flag) for key components. When the component finishes rendering on screen, the [Timing Track](/guide/performance/analysis-performance/trace-track) in Trace generates a bubble at the corresponding timestamp to mark the key stage.

A Lynx page generally has two render types: first-frame rendering and update rendering. Internally, the Lynx SDK produces [LoadBundleEntry](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/load-bundle-entry) and [PipelineEntry](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/pipeline-entry) to describe stage durations in each process.

Click a bubble to open a details panel showing the sub-stage timeline and the duration of each sub-stage in the render process.

The following sections detail both render types and their constituent stages, including the corresponding Trace event names, so you can locate and troubleshoot issues via Trace events.

## First-frame render time analysis

First-frame rendering primarily consists of LoadBundle and Paint:

### LoadBundle

This stage corresponds to `Timing::Mark.loadBundleStart` and `Timing::Mark.loadBundleEnd` in Trace. It mainly parses the bundle and performs the initial screen render. It can be broken down into six sub-stages:

#### Parse

This stage corresponds to `Timing::Mark.parseStart` and `Timing::Mark.parseEnd` in Trace. It parses the binary bundle into in-memory data structures. The bundle contains a header and multiple sections; the JS source section runs on the [background thread](/guide/spec#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread), mapped to `Timing::Mark.loadBackgroundStart` and `Timing::Mark.loadBackgroundEnd` in Trace.

#### MTS Render

This stage corresponds to `Timing::Mark.mtsRenderStart` and `Timing::Mark.mtsRenderEnd` in Trace. It executes [Main Thread Script (MTS)](/guide/spec#main-thread-script-or-mts) to build the Element Tree.

#### Resolve

This stage corresponds to `Timing::Mark.resolveStart` and `Timing::Mark.resolveEnd` in Trace. It traverses the element tree, computes a layout node tree from node attributes and styles, and generates [UI Paint OP](/guide/spec#platform-ui-paint-operations-or-ui-paint-op).

#### Layout

This stage corresponds to `Timing::Mark.layoutStart` and `Timing::Mark.layoutEnd` in Trace. It traverses the layout node tree produced during Resolve, computes node positions and sizes, and generates [UI Layout OP](/guide/spec#platform-ui-layout-operations-or-ui-layout-op).

#### Paint UI OP Execute

This stage corresponds to `Timing::Mark.paintingUiOperationExecuteStart` and `Timing::Mark.paintingUiOperationExecuteEnd` in Trace. It executes the UI Paint OP generated during Resolve.

#### Layout UI OP Execute

This stage corresponds to `Timing::Mark.layoutUiOperationExecuteStart` and `Timing::Mark.layoutUiOperationExecuteEnd` in Trace. It executes the UI Layout OP generated during Layout.

### Paint

The system drawing stage measures, lays out, and paints the platform UI tree. The end of painting maps to `Timing::Mark.paintEnd` in Trace.

## Update render time analysis

Update renders are primarily driven by the background thread to update and draw the UI tree. The main difference from first-frame rendering lies in [Framework Rendering](/guide/spec#framework-rendering). Using ReactLynx 3 as an example, we highlight the differing parts:

### Diff Changes

This stage corresponds to `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.diffVdomStart` and `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.diffVdomEnd` in Trace. It performs component diff on the background thread.

### Pack Changes

This stage corresponds to `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.packChangesStart` and `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.packChangesEnd` in Trace. It serializes diff results and sends them to the [main thread](/guide/spec#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread).

### Parse Changes

This stage corresponds to `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.parseChangesStart` and `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.parseChangesEnd` in Trace. It parses the serialized data on the main thread.

### Patch Changes

This stage corresponds to `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.patchChangesStart` and `Timing::MarkFrameWorkTiming.patchChangesEnd` in Trace. It applies the diff results on the main thread and updates the Element Tree.

Subsequent render stages are similar to the first-frame process: Resolve, Layout, Paint UI OP Execute, Layout UI OP Execute, and Paint.
